# XRPL Training - September 25

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: Version 20 or higher.
- npm: Comes bundled with Node.js, used for dependency management.

You can verify your Node.js version by running:

```
node -v
```

### Installation 

Install all necessary dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

### Usage

#### Available Commands

- To start the project, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will run the main file (src/index.ts) using tsx, which allows executing TypeScript without pre-compilation.
